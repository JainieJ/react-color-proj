Check out this project at https://react-colors-proj.netlify.com/

This code-along project was a part of Colt Steele's course on Udemy. Following the instructor and taking
my time to realize the code, I improved my knowledge of general **React** and learnt how to use **Material UI**.

Besides that, I gained the following skills: working with clipboard and slider **libraries for react**,
as well as **React Router**(using Route, Switch, component, render, history, match, Link, withRouter, etc.),
**Form validation** with material-ui-form-validation package, **drag&drop** with **react-sortable-HOC**, saving user data in **localStorage**.

In general, this was a good project to solidify my skills in working with pure **React** (including **PureComponent**) and since a lot of thrid-party libraries were used, I improved in reading and understanding someone else's code.

However, this project did not cover yet state management and proper file structure, though we did separate CSS from JS.
